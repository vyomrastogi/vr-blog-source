## Backend Developer Roadmap 

This covers the various topics mentioned in [Backend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend). 

I will be trying to cover the roadmap with perspective of a Java developer and also may be give a try to learn Rust. 

The main motive is to keep notes of what all things I am learning and do it regularly.
